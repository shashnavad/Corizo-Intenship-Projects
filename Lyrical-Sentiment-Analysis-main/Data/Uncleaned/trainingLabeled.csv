2014,West Coast,Lana Del Rey,True,"I can see my baby swingin'
Ooh baby baby bae, I love you
I can see my baby swingin'
Ooh baby baby bae, I love you
I can see my baby swingin'
Ooh baby baby bae, I love you
I can see my baby swingin'
Down on the West Coast they got a sayin'
""If you're not drinkin' then you're not playin'""
But you've got the music, you've got the music
In you, don't you?
Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy blue, yeah you
I can see my baby swingin'
I can see my baby swingin'
Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music, you've got the music
In you, don't you?
Down on the West Coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock and roll groupies
And you've got the music, you've got the music
In you, don't you?
I can see my baby swingin'
I can see my baby swingin'
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher

2014,Automatic,Miranda Lambert,True,"Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching sun tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin' time
Seems like only yesterday, I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown 'cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that '55, just like a queen, three on a tree
Hey, what ever happened to waiting your turn
Doing it all by hand?
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seems so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out
Hey, what ever happened to waiting your turn
Doing it all by hand?
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seems so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic, yeah

Let's roll the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on, let's take a picture

2014,Bartender,Lady Antebellum,True,"8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying come on he ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye
What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender
Pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I'll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it's all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay
What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender
Pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
I'm feeling that buzz
I'm ready to rock
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I'm coming in hot

2014,Beat Of The Music,Brett Eldredge,True,"Well, I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town, hey, wouldn't you know
I'd get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico, oh
Now you're walkin' up askin' me to dance
Smilin' that smile and reachin' out your hand
Well, there's a move or two I'd like to show you
While I've still got the chance
You got the soul, and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip 'cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racin' like there's nothin' to it
Fallin' in love to the beat of the music
Oh-oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay? Yeah
Oh-oh, and let that plane fly away, ay-ay, ay-ay

Fallin' in love to the beat of the music

I think I could get used to that steel drum playin'
Wakin' up on a beach if you know what I'm sayin'
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on, baby 'cause

2014,Habits (Stay High),Tove Lo,True,"I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around, and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the 'tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Dazed and kinda lonely
You're gone, and I gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind

Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you

Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive

2014,Afire Love,Ed Sheeran,True,"Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way, I'll cry with the rest of them
And my father told me, ""Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Love, love
And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when
My father told me, ""Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Love, love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
See the love, the love, the love, the love

Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go

I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, and then hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home, but I've drunk all of it now
Not sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another

2014,I Got A Car,George Strait,True,"She was leanin' on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinkin' that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you comin' over, I already thought it over
And ok, so now what
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's somethin'
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothin'
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, what do you think all this is goin'
I said, there ain't no way of knowin'
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car
So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's somethin'

And I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stoppin' place
When the doctor's said, you know what's on the way?
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday mornin', rain pourin' down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out
And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now?
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's somethin'
You think it'll start, I said, it's already runnin'
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are

2014,Don't,Ed Sheeran,True,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (you bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold

Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whipping the bricks

Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through the tears

Got a spirit that can't be tamed
She's a Calico pony on an open plain
I know I'll never be the same no more, for sure

Got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy

Unless you've been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man

But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hmm, we keep this love in this photograph

Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me

Had the guns on the radio

Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time
All that wasted time
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the greed and the game

And having dinner at the country club

But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many

And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew

2016,7 Years,Lukas Graham,True,"Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old
It was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
Once, I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was 11 years old
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was 20 years old
(Lukas Graham!)
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once, I was 20 years old
Soon, we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world, and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be 30 years old
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be 60 years old
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
Then the sign said, ""The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls
In tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence",2015,"Metal, Symphonic rock, Rock",Negative

I held your hair back when
You were throwing up
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold

Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

I transform like this, perform like this

I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA

Burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids, and
I wish I was fed forgiveness

Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was nine, on cell, motel
We didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA (this is why I say that hip hop)

You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation, your DNA, an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go, and sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine

Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherf-ker, I got winners on the way

You ain't sh- without a ticket on your plate

Do we even exist?

I don't even know where he is now
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
Cause everybody has already tried
Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family is gonna want you to stay
You know what I don't blame 'em
So I'll say
What I don't want to
And I'll just pray
You want what I do

Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to heaven, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like No Limit soldier

Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck you, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' the gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow

I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)

Send your ass to the devil, in envelope like a letter

My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me

She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead?
When you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveying you holier, come help get us up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed

Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds

I'm on some ""Fuck a retweet, "" most people is sheep

If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore we just gotta learn everything as we go

Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think

While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope
But I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope
I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games

It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
