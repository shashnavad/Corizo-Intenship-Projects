This repository was made by Shashank Navad

It consists of 2 folders

The first contains -

MNIST Digit Classification which classifies the mnist dataset using artificial neural networks or ANNs.

The second is a folder which contains -

i) The dataset feature_3_sec.csv which contains data regarding various .wav with an interval of 3 seconds taken from 
the GTZAN dataset available on kaggle

ii) A sample .wav file which contains 'blues' type of music specifically required for showing the type of data present
in the dataset and data visualization in the main ipynb file.

iii) An ipynb file which contains python code for music genre classification using the KNN classifier as well as
a comparision of the same with convolutional neural networks(CNNs).

*** Important Note - the location of the csv file and the .wav file will have to be changed to their respective file paths to be run
on a client system.
